I am proship and anti-harassment, I don't ship much that could be seen as "problematic" (I like my vanilla ships lol) but I still think that you shouldn't be a prick to someons just because you don't like the same tropes they do. If you're "neutral" or just not very active in the "proship vs antiship" discourse then don't be shy to talk with me, I don't mind as long as you aren't unnecessarily rude

I come onto this game to chill so if you try starting an argument because of what I personally believe I'll just block you, if you wanna talk about your personal opinions about what I think please do it in a respectful manner or I won't bother to engage with you :p
